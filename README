JASE - Just Another Shell Extension
-----------------------------------

This is a small shell extension which adds a couple of useful functions to
the right-click menu in Windows Explorer.

* Copy filename - copies the filename(s) of the currently selected file(s)
  or folder(s) to the clipboard. Supports different formats.
* Add folder to path - when right-clicking on a folder, you can add that
  folder to the PATH environment variable.

Build using Visual Studio and then simply 
> regsvr32 JASE64.dll.


I put this up on GitHub since there are people using it, and I don't have
a Windows development machine anymore. So even though I can't build an update, 
at least the source code is preserved if anyone needs or wants it.
